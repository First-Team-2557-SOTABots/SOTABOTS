SOTABOTS
========

This is a fork from the 2014 FRC Challenge "Aerial Assist".
Code was introduced by Frankie Lyon, who was in charge of mentoring members of the team.

This code uses "SimpleRobot" code, and shows a direct, line for line, progrmaming of the robot code.

This fork will be to implement any changes that may be made by the (hopefully) 2015 authors, as well as myself.
